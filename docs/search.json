    "text": "Hey there! I'm Michael Lopez, a Data Analyst with a foundation in both the non-profit sector and data analysis, with over four years of dedicated analysis experience alongside nearly a decade of  involvement in non-profit initiatives. A Miami native, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Florida International University, in Psychology and Anthropology. Before moving to Dallas, TX, where I to joined a research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas before subsequently enrolling in their Masters of Public Policy program.\n        \n    \n\nMy time in Dallas has allowed me to partner with non-profit organizations dedicated to impactful place-based initiatives. My role at the Child Poverty Action Lab has allowed me to leverage data in transformative ways, enhancing program capabilities within Dallas County and the City of Dallas through actionable insights and meaningful conversations with stakeholders. Through my proficiency in R, alongside a strong ability to create engaging tools and reports with Shiny and Quarto. Additionally, my grasp of SQL and various other analytical tools complements my skill set. What truly sets me apart is my adaptability, curiosity, and ability to simplify complex data for a diverse audience. These attributes have been instrumental in not just meeting the dynamic needs of projects, but also in fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within my teams.\nI dive into every project with an eye for analytical depth and imaginative solutions, motivated by a commitment to contribute to social good through the power of data. I’m keen to continue exploring how my unique blend of skills, experience, and personal interests can drive meaningful change and create lasting impacts.\n\nPortfolio\nThroughout this portfolio, you will find a collection of projects that were either created solely by myself or where I served as the lead analyst. The analyses were conducted primarily in R, leveraging a diverse range of data visualization and analysis techniques. The final products were generated using R Shiny or Quarto, ensuring a strong emphasis on reproducibility. Notably, projects labeled with the “External Developer” tag denote collaborations with external developers, where I spearheaded the data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and led the analysis efforts. These projects highlight my expertise in combining analytical skills with a keen focus on reproducible workflows to deliver impactful insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomestead Exemptions in Dallas County\n\n\n\nHousing\n\n\nMapping Tool\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nThis mapping tool allows users to explore the uptake of homestead exemptions for homeowners across Dallas County, and view metrics related to home exemption uptake for eligbile households.\n\n\n\nFeb 23, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhood Eviction Housing Profiles\n\n\n\nHousing\n\n\nFact Sheet\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nA neighborhood fact sheet lookup tool that provides users with the ability to review idenfied housing and eviction metrics in neighborhoods across the City of Dallas.\n\n\n\nFeb 9, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust Her Clinic finder\n\n\n\nMaternal Health\n\n\nMapping Tool\n\n\nExternal Developer\n\n\n\nThis mapping tool allows users to explore the areas with the highest proportions of teen births across zip codes in Dallas County.\n\n\n\nJan 26, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Teen Births in Dallas County Zip Codes\n\n\n\nMaternal Health\n\n\nMapping Tool\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nThis mapping tool allows users to explore the areas with the highest proportions of teen births across zip codes in Dallas County.\n\n\n\nJan 26, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Poverty in Dallas\n\n\n\nOrganizational\n\n\nMapping Tool\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nThis mapping tool allows users to explore the areas with the highest proportions of child poverty across the City of Dallas and pinpoint specific areas of the city with high need for relief.\n\n\n\nJan 12, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren Affected by Poverty\n\n\n\nOrganizational\n\n\nMapping Tool\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nThis mapping tool allows users to define custom service areas based on administrative boundaries (census tracts or zctas) to calculate demograpgic and poverty related metrics within their custom service areas.\n\n\n\nJan 5, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhood Safety Dashboard\n\n\n\nSafety\n\n\nDashboard\n\n\nR Shiny\n\n\n\nA neighborhood centered dashboard using bcWorkshop neighborhoods where users can explore neighbohoods across the City of Dallas to learn about police incidents or 311 reports that have occurred.\n\n\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPAL Child Poverty Changes Report\n\n\n\nOrganizational\n\n\nWeb Report\n\n\nQuarto\n\n\n\nA web report collating a number of city wide metrics important to organizational goals across all Child Poverty Action Lab domain areas.
