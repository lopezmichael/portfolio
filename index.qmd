            Hey there! I'm Michael Lopez, a Data Analyst with a foundation in both the non-profit sector and data analysis, with over four years of dedicated analysis experience alongside nearly a decade of  involvement in non-profit initiatives.

My time in Dallas has allowed me to partner with non-profit organizations dedicated to impactful place-based initiatives. My role at the Child Poverty Action Lab has allowed me to leverage data in transformative ways, enhancing program capabilities within Dallas County and the City of Dallas through actionable insights and meaningful conversations with stakeholders. Through my proficiency in R, alongside a strong ability to create engaging tools and reports with Shiny and Quarto. Additionally, my grasp of SQL and various other analytical tools complements my skill set. What truly sets me apart is my adaptability, curiosity, and ability to simplify complex data for a diverse audience. These attributes have been instrumental in not just meeting the dynamic needs of projects, but also in fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within my teams.

I dive into every project with an eye for analytical depth and imaginative solutions, motivated by a  commitment to contribute to social good through the power of data. I'm keen to continue exploring how my unique blend of skills, experience, and personal interests can drive meaningful change and create lasting impacts.

# Portfolio

Throughout this portfolio, you will find a collection of projects that were either created solely by myself or where I served as the lead analyst. The analyses were conducted primarily in R, leveraging a diverse range of data visualization and analysis techniques. The final products were generated using R Shiny or Quarto, ensuring a strong emphasis on reproducibility. Notably, projects labeled with the "External Developer" tag denote collaborations with external developers, where I spearheaded the data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and led the analysis efforts. These projects highlight my expertise in combining analytical skills with a keen focus on reproducible workflows to deliver impactful insights.
